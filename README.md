# Student Attendance Management with SQL Server

> [Ver en ESPAÑOL](LÉEME.md)

## Description
This project is designed to manage the attendance records of an educational institution (school) using SQL Server. It includes the creation and management of a database that tracks student attendance, teacher assignments, and class schedules. The database structure is designed to optimize the allocation of teachers to courses and maintain updated information on student attendance, aiding in informed decision-making for educational management.

More details and explanations of the database design and example queries are available here:
